# Library contribution (validator)

## Purpose

Experience reaches other projects through the libraries this project's loops and roles came from: the framework's, the community's and this package's. This loop sends the loops and roles this project added or changed since it was installed, each back to the library it came from (a new one any project can use, to the community's), with the owner's approval of exactly what leaves, as one pull request per library that its maintainers review. Validator roles may describe how tests are constructed but must never contain an actual test, so every plan is checked against the hidden tests before the owner sees it. The owner runs the loop when they want to, any time after one review has been published, and again whenever there is something new.

## Inputs

- `answers`: the owner's replies so far, by review id; the session adds each one as it comes (see `running-loops.md`).

## Steps

1. **Plan** — `library-contributor` plans what would leave (`{action: "plan", exclude, notes}`): a status, the units it would send with the library each goes to and its judgement of each, what it would not send and why, the files that would leave, the defects the library check found in the result, and the plan's digest. `not-eligible`, `nothing` and `unavailable` end the loop with the reason; `no-library` goes to step 2.
2. **Checkout** — `owner-review` asks whether to fetch a checkout of the repository this project was installed from, at the address the plan names (`review_id` `clone:<address>`). On approval `library-contributor` clones it (`{action: "clone"}`) and the loop plans again; otherwise the loop ends.
3. **Leak check** — `leak-reviewer`, from a fresh context, checks exactly the files that would leave against the hidden tests and records its verdict on the plan's digest (`{action: "check-library", digest, files}`).
4. **Review** — `owner-review` puts the plan to the owner (`review_id` `contribution:<digest>`): every unit with its judgement and warnings, what was left out and why, the library check and the leak check's verdict with its findings. Approval is possible only when the library check found no defect and the leak check passed. On `revise`, the owner's words go back to step 1 as `notes`; on `cancel` the loop ends.
5. **Contribute** — on approval, `library-contributor` sends exactly that plan (`{action: "contribute", digest, exclude}`), and the loop ends with the pull requests, one per library, or with what stood in their way.

## Bounds

At most 6 plans per run: the first, and one after each review or checkout.

## Waiting

Steps 2 and 4 wait for the owner: the loop returns `{waiting: "owner", review_id, question, document}`, and the session runs it again with the reply in `answers`.

## Triggers

- `record-trajectory`: every role that finishes leaves its trajectory.
- `guard-owner-answers`: every answer the session passes in is the owner's own message, typed after the loop stopped at that review; anything else is blocked before the loop runs.
